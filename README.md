# Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and testing contains images of cats and dogs, and the goal is to build an SVM classifier that can accurately classify these images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset of cat and dog images.
- `features/`: Directory to store pre-extracted features and labels.
- `svm_classification.py`: Python script for SVM classification.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- scikit-learn (for SVM classifier)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for feature extraction)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Organize your dataset with two subdirectories, one for cats and one for dogs, inside the `data/` directory.

2. **Feature Extraction**:

   - Train a CNN model (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras) for feature extraction. Save the extracted features and labels.

   - Alternatively, you can use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16) and extract features from it.

3. **Training**:

   - Run the `svm_classification.py` script to train an SVM classifier using the pre-extracted features.

4. **Testing**:

   - Classify new images by passing them through the trained SVM classifier. Example code is provided in `svm_classification.py`.

## Training the SVM Classifier

Modify the `svm_classification.py` script to include the path to your pre-extracted features, labels, and your SVM classifier configuration. Then, run the script.

```bash
python svm_classification.py
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of your SVM classifier using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters if needed to improve classification .
